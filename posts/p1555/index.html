I was testing on Chrome Canary [60.0.3103.0] because I wanted to make sure the trick worked also in the next versions of Chrome.\nIn the middle of my research I stumbled upon a way to load data-uris on the main window (top frame), something that I vaguely remembered was blocked in Chrome 60, or at least I thought I’ve seen a tweet by Nasko mentioning that. Either way, I immediately reported it to Chromium using their system. Here’s the case, it is still restricted but it’ll be public soon, but the point is, four minutes later people started debating on the problem and the fix. I’m not exaggerating when I say “four minutes later”.\nAt the same time and motivated by a very interesting question from Gareth, I sent the same issue to the Microsoft Security Response Center via their email [secure at microsoft.com]. To be clear, I already had that trick for Edge, but I didn’t disclosed with Microsoft because as you probably know, I have very different views on how they are handling the security of their browsers. Either way, I sent them the bug 29 minutes after I sent the same issue in Chrome. What was the idea? Just test who was patching first!\nThis was the same issue on both browsers, but the trick required more steps in Chrome, which seemed harder to patch. This is how it looks on both browsers:\nHonestly, I never felt that being able to load data-uris on the top frame was insecure, however, scammers are using it all the time to confuse people: final users can’t see the real origin in the address bar. But either way each browser prevent us -by default- to load data-uris, but with a little trick we can quickly achieve the same effect. Now the question is, how was it handled by Google and Microsoft?\nGoogle guys had a potential fix 20 hours later. It is not fixed yet, but the source code change is there, public for everyone to see.\nMicrosoft Security Response Center replied me two hours later with a default message saying that they have opened case 38773. Then the case manager (which BTW is very cool guy) told me that he forwarded the information to the engineers.\nSo essentially, on Google Chrome we have the patch which is going to be applied pretty soon, around 3 business days after my initial report. On Microsoft Edge, the engineers are going to read the email pretty soon (or if they did, I have no idea).\nI see big differences in speed of execution and transparency. In Chrome, the security researcher who reported the bug is aware of every step in the process and even part of the discussion. On Edge? Email sent and now wait without updates of anything.\nIs anybody at Microsoft proud of how the company manages these things? Edge exists right now because it comes with the OS and users are almost forced to use it! Every other update it sets itself as default, plus the new tab on IE that takes you to Edge, the ads claiming that battery last longer than Chrome?. Come on! I accept marketing when the product behind it is what marketing claims it to be, but this is not Edge’s case.\nGuys, please, remember that there’s a battle going on and Google is kicking your ass, badly. That’s a fact, not my truth or marketing. Hear it again please: Google Chrome is kicking your ass badly. Either you work for real and you have chances to position in the market again, or you keep that marketing thing until you are completely our of the browser wars.
